// actually, I don't have admin access easily without credentials.
// But I have the login credentials for the test user: email: `test_${Date.now()}@example.com` (from previous run) and password "password123".
// Wait, the previous run used a dynamic email, so I don't know the EXACT email unless I can see the console output from the *user's* previous run or if I search for it.
// The user said "a user has been created automatically which is test".
// Maybe I can just use a backend script? Use the models directly!
// I am on the user's machine, I have access to the backend code. 
// BUT, I cannot connect to the production MongoDB directly unless I have the connection string.
// I can use the existing backend code to write a script that connects to Mongoose and deletes it.

// Let's check backend/index.js or .env to see how it connects.
// .env is likely NOT fully visible or might use a local mongo URI in dev?
// But the user is complaining about the LIVE user (on Render/Vercel)? Or local?
// "test remove it" - likely local if they are seeing it in their list.
// If it's local, I can use a local script. 
// If it's remote, I need the MONGO_URI.

// Let's try to find the MONGO_URI from the backend .env file.
